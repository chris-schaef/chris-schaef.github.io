        <p class="bio"> As someone who has spent the majority of his life playing piano, Patrick loves playing almost as much as he loves singing.
             He is more than happy to play at weddings and other ceremonies if asked to do so. 
            Furthermore, Patrick has a history of writing. Inspired by Weird Al Yankovic, at age 14 Patrick became the youngest artist played on the Dr. Demento show.</p>
